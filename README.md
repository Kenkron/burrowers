**Minecraft Mod for Creatures that can Destroy Terrain**

For too long, the players of the overworld have been out of our reach.  Hiding behind wooden doors, and meter-thick walls of stone, the players have grown lazy an weak, imagining that they will never again need to pay mind to we, the most wreched of night creatures.

*But they are wrong*

In our deprivation, some of us have grown, become stronger, and evolved to slice through the walls that the players build so readily.  We strike at the full moon, and there's nothing the players can do to stop us.

MUAHAHAHAHA!
